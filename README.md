# Rhythm-based Control System

The rhythm-based control system for RPG Maker.

This plugin helps you to build a rhythm game. In the game, player must move following the beats of BGM. You can define your own events in order to have different actions related to the score of player's input, e.g. player had a "Perfect" score can knockout monsters nearby, or player had a "Miss" score cannot move.

*Inspired by: [Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/)*
